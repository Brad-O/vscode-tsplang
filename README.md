> TSP language support for VSCode

The TSP language extension for Visual Studio Code provides command completions for your TSP-enabled Keithley Instruments.

## Requirements

To enable TSP command completions for [supported instruments](#supportedinstruments), a shebang line is required. TSP shebangs take the form of
```
--#!<model>
```
where `<model>` is a supported instrument model.

## Supported Instruments

The following instruments are currently supported:
* 2450
* 2460
* 2461
* 2461-SYS
* 6500
