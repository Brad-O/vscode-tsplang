For example, for current measurements, if you expect a reading of approximately 9mA, set the range to 9 mA to select the 10mA range. When you read this setting, you see the positive full-scale value of the measurement range that the instrument is presently using.\n\nThis command is primarily intended to eliminate the time that is required by the instrument to automatically search for a range.\n\nWhen a range is fixed, any signal greater than the entered range generates an overrange condition. When an overrange condition occurs, the front panel displays "Overflow" and the remote interface returns 9.9e+37.\n\nIf the source function is the same as the measurement function (for example, sourcing voltage and measuring voltage), the measurement range is the same as the source range, regardless of measurement range setting. However, the setting for the measure range is retained, and when the source function is changed (for example, from sourcing voltage to sourcing current), the retained measurement range is used.\n\nIf you change the range while the output is off, the instrument does not update the hardware settings, but if you read the range setting, the return is the setting that will be used when the output is turned on. If you set a range while the output is on, the new setting takes effect immediately.'

A measurement is made for each point of the sweep.\n\nWhen the sweep command is sent, it clears the existing trigger model and creates a new trigger model. To run the sweep, initiate the trigger model.\n\nThe sweep continues until the source outputs the specified stop level. At this level, the instrument performs another measurement and then stops the sweep.\n\nWhen you specify a delay, a delay block is added to the sweep trigger model. This delay is added to any source delay you may have set. For example, if you set 10 ms for the source delay and 25 ms for the delay in the for the log sweep command, the actual delay is 35 ms.\n\nThe range type specifies the source range that is used for the sweep. You can select the following options:\n\nThe asymptote changes the inflection of the sweep curve and allows it to sweep through zero. You can use the asymptote parameter to customize the inflection and offset of the source value curve. Setting this parameter to zero provides a conventional logarithmic sweep. The asymptote value is the value that the curve has at either positive or negative infinity, depending on the direction of the sweep. The asymptote value must not be equal to or between the starting and ending values. It must be outside the range defined by the starting and ending values.'
